<!-- hyperlinks in #5499C7 -->
I am a senior software developer in [Dr. Ted Satterthwaite's](https://www.pennlinc.io/team/Ted-Satterthwaite)
[Lifespan Informatics & Neuroimaging Center](https://www.pennlinc.io) at the
[University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).

I graduated from Florida International University with a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience.
My advisor was [Dr. Angie Laird](https://nbclab.github.io/team/laird-angela).
My primary focuses in graduate school were on neuroimaging meta-analysis and multi-echo fMRI data analysis.

Prior to graduate school, I graduated from Cornell University with a B.A. in Psychology,
before spending two years as a research assistant at Dr. Cameron Carter's
[Translational Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab](http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/front/index.php)
at the University of California, Davis.

I am interested in meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, the improvement and standardization of statistical methods in
cognitive neuroscience, management of large datasets, and open source software development.

Outside of my research projects, I am the primary maintainer of
[XCP-D](https://xcp-d.readthedocs.io) and [ASLPrep](https://aslprep.readthedocs.io/),
a core developer of [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.io),
and a member of the maintainers group for the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io).
I also do what I can to help maintain other tools from the PennLINC lab, including CuBIDS, BABS, and QSIPrep.

I was also the primary developer of [NiMARE](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
a Python library for neuroimaging meta-analyses, during grad school.
