<!-- hyperlinks in #5499C7 -->
I am a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Psychology at [Florida International University](http://www.fiu.edu), specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience.
I work with [Dr. Angela Laird](https://nbclab.github.io/team/angela-laird) in her [Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity lab](https://nbclab.github.io/).

I graduated from Cornell University with a B.A. in Psychology, before spending two years as a research assistant at Dr. Cameron Carter's [Translational Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab](http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/front/index.php) at University of California, Davis.

I am interested in meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, the improvement and standardization of statistical methods in cognitive neuroscience, optimal management of large datasets, and open source software development.
