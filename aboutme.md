<!-- hyperlinks in #5499C7 -->
I am a sixth-year doctoral student in the Department of Psychology at [Florida International University](http://www.fiu.edu),
specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience.
I work with [Dr. Angela Laird](https://nbclab.github.io/team/angela-laird) in her
[Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity lab](https://nbclab.github.io/).

I graduated from Cornell University with a B.A. in Psychology, before spending two years as a research assistant at
Dr. Cameron Carter's [Translational Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab](http://carterlab.ucdavis.edu/front/index.php)
at the University of California, Davis.

I am interested in meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies, the improvement and standardization of statistical methods in
cognitive neuroscience, optimal management of large datasets, and open source software development.

Outside of my research projects, I am the primary developer of
[NiMARE](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for neuroimaging meta-analyses,
a core developer of [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Python library for multi-echo fMRI denoising,
and a member of the maintainers group for the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io).
